## Lessons Learned
- **Data Cleaning & Formatting Are Crucial**
I learned that preparing the dataset (e.g., correcting date formats, removing blanks, and structuring product categories) is essential before analysis can even begin.
- **Effective Dashboard Design Enhances Insight**
Keeping visualizations clear and minimal helped communicate findings effectively. I also learned how to use slicers and layout tools in Excel for interactivity.

## Challenges Faced
- **Handling Inconsistent Date Formats**
The dataset contained mixed date formats which caused filtering issues until resolved through Excel’s data transformation functions.
- **Choosing the Right Visualizations**
Selecting the appropriate chart types to show trends versus rankings (e.g., line chart vs. column chart) took several iterations to get right.

## Conclusion
This project strengthened my understanding of business intelligence with Excel, especially in areas of dashboard creation, KPI tracking, and visual storytelling. It also gave me real-world exposure to working with categorical and time-series sales data.
